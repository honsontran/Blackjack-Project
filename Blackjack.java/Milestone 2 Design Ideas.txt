To claim insurance: I can set a boolean for the player so that if the dealer gets an ace, it will ask each dealer by going
	through the array of players and asking them if they want insurance or not. If the dealer hits 21, it will return
	the half of the wager back to the dealer.

Splitting: If a player's hand has the same face, it will ask the option to ask if the player would like to split. If it does, it will create another hand
	for the player, which is in another array. the player will play each hand seperately and will each have its separate array with its own value.

Doubling down: For the doubling down, I can create a method that will ask the player to double down once the first two cards are dealt.
